This is a list of changes I had to make to spinterp version 5.1.1
that can be downloaded here: https://www.researchgate.net/publication/330956911_Sparse_Grid_Interpolation_Toolbox_v511

1) private/spgridm.m

		c = repmat(shiftdim(c, 1-double(i)), repvec');

		replaces 

		c = repmat(shiftdim(c, 1-double(i)), repvec);

		because repmat requires a row vector as an input of the second variable, not a column vector. 
		This change copies the corresponding code in spinterp version 2.1.
